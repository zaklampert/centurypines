## Serving the Senior Population of Southwest Missouri for Over 30 years

Century Pines has been serving the senior population of Christian, Greene and the surrounding counties for nearly 40 years. It began as a small family owned and operated long term care facility in 1980. There have been many changes over the years. However, one thing remains constant, our family's commitment to superior care, comfort, and accomodations for our residents.



A poem about Century Pines by resident "Chipper" Ginny Abel

<div style="text-align: center;">

**Home**

I enjoy life at the place I live

where God's love people do give

each one may seem to be ill

nurses are there to give a pill

the many services are truly great

thus receiving a number one rate

our housekeeper is on the ball

no clutter, lest anyone should fall

the cook passes most every test

his dinners are the very best

the nurses and the nurse's aides

truly rank in the finest grades

the other employees make your day

as one and all join in to pray

so come here if you need care

you'll find it's the best anywhere!

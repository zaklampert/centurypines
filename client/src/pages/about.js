            Century Pines is licensed by the State of Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services, the Veterans Administration, and the Missouri Department of Mental Health as a <strong>Level
            II Assisted Living Community</strong>. This is the highest level of care permitted by the State of Missouri for an assisted living community. This allows many
            of our residents to "age in place" without being transferred to a nursing home when their needs increase.
          </p>
           <p>
            We are held to strict regulations in regard to our
            operation and care of our residents. Each year the State of Missouri conducts a minimum of four "unannounced" inspections to ensure quality care
            for our residents.

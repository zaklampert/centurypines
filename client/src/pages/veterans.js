          Century Pines is considered a preferred assisted living community by the Veterans Administration. Should a Veteran and/or their spouse qualify, additional funding is
          available for the cost of their care. </p>

        <p>
            We are very knowledgable as to the guidelines set forth by the VA for this funding. On behalf of the family and the resident, we will complete the application,
            as well as other documentation required by the VA for the processing of the request funding.
        </p>
        <p>
          We welcome you to contact Jim Edwards for more information in regard to this posible source of funding.
